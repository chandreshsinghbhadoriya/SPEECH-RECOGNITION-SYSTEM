DESCRIPTION : Tool Used:
 Wav2Vec 2.0
(from Facebook AI, via Hugging Face Transformers)

What is Wav2Vec 2.0?
Wav2Vec 2.0 is a self-supervised deep learning model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) developed by Facebook AI (now Meta AI).

It is designed to convert raw audio waveforms directly into text â€” without needing handcrafted features or complex preprocessing.

When to Use Wav2Vec2:
You need offline speech recognition.

You want high accuracy without using commercial APIs.

You work with large-scale voice data or build voice apps.


Wav2Vec 2.0 is a pretrained deep learning model by Facebook AI for speech-to-text.

It converts raw audio (e.g., .wav files) directly into text.

Works offline, does not require an internet connection or API key.

Highly accurate and suitable for general-purpose English speech recognition.

Powered by PyTorch, torchaudio, and transformers libraries.
